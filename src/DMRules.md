# DM Rules

A DM is a channel with type `dm` and is created between two users.

DM channels are created in the UserPanel.

When a DM is created the creator and the other user are added to the channel.

If a user tries to create a DM with a user and there is already a DM channel between the two users, the existing DM channel is opened instead of creating a new one.
* Note: If user A dms user B first, that opens a channel.  If user B later tries to open a DM with user A, the existing channel is opened instead of creating a new one.


# DMs displayed in the ConversationPanel

DMs are displayed in the ConversationPanel under the "Direct Messages" section.  If user A dms user B then A and B should be added to the DM channel.  User A should gain a new DM channel in the ConversationPanel.  User B should gain a new DM channel in the ConversationPanel.
